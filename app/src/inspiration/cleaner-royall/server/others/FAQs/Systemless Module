Usage Guidelines:

Stable but not Bug-Free: While the module is stable, occasional bugs may occur. Regular monitoring is recommended.


Online Patches & Updates:

Weekly online patches improve functionality and address bugs. Keep your module updated.

Use the Patch Manager to remove unnecessary or downloaded patches for better resource management.


Important Notes:

This is one of the most powerful cleaning modules available, but misuse can cause issues. Use responsibly.

Stay proactive in checking logs or actions to ensure the module isnâ€™t interrupted by the Android system.


With this robust module, you can keep your device optimized, clean, and free of unnecessary clutter without lifting a finger.
