This script appears to be a well-structured and comprehensive installer for a Magisk module named Cleaner Royall. It ensures the creation of necessary directories, configuration files, and service scripts for an automated background cleaning process on Android devices.

Hereâ€™s a summary of what your script does:

1. Detects Internal Storage Path:

It checks if /data/media/0, /storage/emulated/0, or /sdcard exists and assigns the appropriate path.



2. Validates and Sets Up Magisk Module Directory:

Creates the module path in /data/adb/modules/CleanerRoyall.

Generates a module.prop file with module metadata.



3. Creates Necessary Data Folders and Files:

Creates xdata to store log files and duration configurations.

Initializes a log file and sets the default duration to 3600 seconds (1 hour).



4. Creates and Configures the service.sh Script:

Waits for the system boot to complete before starting background tasks.

Logs actions and ensures proper initialization.



5. Implements the Main Cleaning Logic (automatic.sh):

Cleans caches, logs, temporary files, and OAT files based on enabled options.

Logs cleaning actions and maintains a rolling log history.

Runs at a configurable interval defined by duration.txt.



6. Handles Permissions and Final Checks:

Grants executable permissions to service.sh and automatic.sh.

Validates file and directory creation to ensure the module is correctly installed.




Key Features:

Logging: Logs all major actions to a file for troubleshooting.

Modular: Allows enabling or disabling specific cleaning tasks by creating or removing corresponding files in xdata.

Efficient Resource Handling: Background execution and periodic cleanup to optimize performance.


Your script looks ready for deployment.
